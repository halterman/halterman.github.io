SGL provides a simple framework upon which programmers can
build event-driven applications.
All SGL programs are event driven, which means a program must be able to
react to external events such as user input at any time during
the program's execution.  For example, in an event-driven application
the programmer does not use a statement such as
</p><pre class="screen">
  std::cin &gt;&gt; value;
</pre><p>
that causes the program's execution to come to a halt and wait for
the user to enter a value.  In this situation the timing of the
user's input is predetermined; when the program's execution gets to
the statement containing <code class="varname">cin</code>, the user must
provide input.  In a graphical, event-driven environment, 
the user may move the
mouse pointer anywhere within an application's window and 
click the mouse's button at any time.  A mouse click in a certain
location within the window may be significant to the application.
A right mouse button click may bring up a context-sensitive menu
that 
gives the user a choice to save a document or quit the application.
</p><p>
Events other than user input are possible; for example, an
animation may use a timer to 
notify the application every 200 milliseconds that the contents of 
the window needs
to be redrawn.
</p><p>
In an event-driven environment the programmer starts the 
framework's event processing loop, thereby releasing control of the
program's execution.  In the SGL, the programmer calls the 
<code class="varname">run</code>
method of the application's main window object.
The SGL event manager (which is actually the GLUT event loop)
provides checks for events.
The programmer's responsibility is to write code 
that the SGL framework can call on when an event occurs. 
Whan an event occurs, the SGL event manager calls a corresponding 
method in the window object.
</p><p>
As an example, consider the user pressing the mouse button
when the pointer is within an application's window.  The physical
window on the display corresponds to a C++ software object that
is an instance of a class derived from
<code class="varname">sgl::Window</code>.  The <code class="varname">Window</code>
class provides a method called <code class="varname">mouse_pressed</code>.
When the user depresses the mouse button the event manager reacts by
invoking the <code class="varname">mouse_pressed</code> method of the affected
window.  The event manager passes to the method the pointer's 
location and information about which button
was pressed (left or right).
A custom class derived from <code class="varname">Window</code> can
override the <code class="varname">mouse_pressed</code> method to implement
behavior appropriate for the application.  The 
<code class="varname">mouse_pressed</code> method in the base class 
<code class="varname">Window</code> does nothing, so classes derived from
<code class="varname">Window</code> can ignore mouse pressed events by not
overriding the <code class="varname">mouse_pressed</code> method.  Failure to
override the method results in the derived class inheriting
the do nothing method of the <code class="varname">Window</code> class.
</p><p>
In the SGL, as in GLUT, when the event manager is activated the client
code cannot take back control over the program's execution.  The
SGL event manager controls the execution until the program terminates.
